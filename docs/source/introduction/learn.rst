In the next few chapters, you will learn how to :ref:`Install HiClass` and set up your own hierarchical machine learning pipelines.

Once you are set up, we suggest working through our examples, including:

- A typical :ref:`A "Hello World" example`, for an entry-level description of the main concepts.
- Further examples are displayed in our :ref:`Gallery of Examples`, to give you hands-on experience.

We also recommend the sections :ref:`Algorithms Overview` and :ref:`API reference documentation` for additional information.
