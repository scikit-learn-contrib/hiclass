Virtual environments
====================

The main purpose of Python virtual environments is to create an isolated environment for a Python project to have its own dependencies, regardless of other projects. We recommend that you create a new virtual environment for HiClass.

Depending on your preferred installation method, you can create virtual environments for working with HiClass as follows:

- With :ref:`conda`, a package and environment manager program bundled with Anaconda.

- Without Anaconda, using :ref:`venv` or :ref:`pipenv`.
