Algorithms Overview
===================

HiClass provides implementations for the most popular machine learning models for hierarchical classification, including the Local Classifier Per Node, the Local Classifier Per Parent Node and the Local Classifier Per Level. Additionally, the library includes metrics to evaluate model performance on hierarchical data. In this section we present in details the different approaches for hierarchical classification as well as the hierarchical metrics.
